Problem:
For increasing constants c, algorithm produces the following lemmas:
1) i < c (which will never get inductive)
2) (i > c) implies (A[c]=0)

convex closure would yield for increasing constants c: 
(i > c) implies (forall 1<=x<c : A[x] = 0) (which would still be divergent)

The thing we actually want is 
forall y: (i > y) implies (forall 1<=x<y : A[x] = 0)
